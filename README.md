# Employee Management System

## Project Description

* This python project is able to create, read, update and delete employee entries. 
* This is done by using the built-in library SQLite3 to create a small database and using the object-orientated approach to encapsulate the specific code of SQLite3 into functions to make it easier for programmers to use the program.
